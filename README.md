**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
1. The Birth of Software ENgineering (1968)
2. The Rise of Structured Engineering (1970s - 1980s)
3. The Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001 - Present)
   
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in response to the software crisis—a period when large-scale software projects were failing due to poor development practices, cost overruns, and unreliable software.
This milestone established the need for systematic engineering principles in software development, emphasizing structured methodologies, rigorous testing, and improved project management.
2.  The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s–1980s)
Before structured programming, software development was largely ad hoc, relying on goto statements that made programs difficult to maintain.
The introduction of structured programming by Edsger Dijkstra promoted clear, logical program flow using loops, conditionals, and modular design.
Languages such as Pascal, C, and Ada emerged to support structured programming principles, improving software reliability and maintainability.
3. The Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001–Present)
Traditional software development followed rigid, plan-driven models like Waterfall, but these approaches struggled with rapidly changing requirements.
The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced a new way of thinking, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.
Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban have since revolutionized software engineering, enabling faster development cycles and continuous user feedback.
These milestones have collectively shaped modern software engineering, leading to more efficient, scalable, and user-centric development practices.


**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
1. Planning
2. Requirement Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation (Coding)
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance and Support

1. Planning
This phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, feasibility, and potential risks.
Stakeholders discuss requirements, budgets, timelines, and resources needed for development.
2. Requirement Analysis
Developers and business analysts gather and document user and system requirements.
Functional and non-functional requirements are specified, often resulting in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
3. Design
The system architecture, database design, and overall software structure are planned.
High-level design (HLD) outlines modules, data flow, and integration, while low-level design (LLD) details individual components.
4. Implementation (Coding)
Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.
This phase follows coding standards and best practices to ensure maintainability and efficiency.
5. Testing
The software undergoes various tests (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing) to identify and fix bugs.
The goal is to ensure the software meets the requirements and functions as expected.
6. Deployment
The software is released for use, either as a full deployment or in phases (e.g., beta testing, pilot release).
Deployment may be on-premises, cloud-based, or through app stores.
7. Maintenance and Support
After release, ongoing maintenance includes bug fixes, performance improvements, security updates, and enhancements.
This phase ensures long-term software usability and stability.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate**.
1. Approach
Waterfall: A linear and sequential model where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile: An iterative and incremental model where development occurs in short cycles (sprints), allowing for continuous feedback and improvements.
2. Flexibility
Waterfall: Rigid, making it difficult to accommodate changes once a phase is completed.
Agile: Highly flexible, allowing continuous modifications based on customer and team feedback.
3. Customer Involvement
Waterfall: Minimal customer involvement; the product is typically delivered at the end of development.
Agile: High customer involvement, with regular feedback incorporated throughout the development process.
4. Delivery Time
Waterfall: The final product is delivered at the end of the project.
Agile: Continuous delivery of working software in short iterations.
5. Documentation
Waterfall: Requires extensive documentation before development begins to ensure everything is clearly defined.
Agile: Documentation is lighter, with a focus on working software rather than detailed paperwork.
6. Testing
Waterfall: Testing is performed after the development phase is completed.
Agile: Testing happens throughout development, ensuring early bug detection.
7. Best Use Cases
✅ Waterfall is best for:

Projects with fixed and well-defined requirements.
Industries that require thorough documentation (e.g., healthcare, finance, government).
Safety-critical systems where reliability is crucial (e.g., aerospace, medical devices).
Example: A government tax-filing system that must comply with strict regulations would benefit from Waterfall’s structured approach.

✅ Agile is best for:

Projects where requirements may change frequently.
Startups or businesses developing new products based on customer feedback.
User-centric applications that require continuous updates (e.g., mobile apps, web applications).
Example: If PLP is developing a new social media app, it would use Agile to quickly iterate based on user behavior and market demands.

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
Software testing ensures that applications function correctly, meet requirements, and are free of critical defects. The key types of testing are Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and Acceptance Testing, each serving a different purpose in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

1. Unit Testing
📌 Definition:

Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
Developers write unit tests to verify that each piece of code (e.g., a function, method, or class) produces the expected output.
🔹 Importance:

Helps detect and fix bugs early in development.
Encourages writing modular and maintainable code.
Enables test-driven development (TDD), where tests are written before the actual code.
🔸 Example:

Testing a function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart.
Tools: JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), Jest (JavaScript).
2. Integration Testing
📌 Definition:

Integration testing checks how different modules or components interact with each other.
It ensures that data flow and communication between integrated parts of the system work as expected.
🔹 Importance:

Detects errors in module-to-module interaction early.
Verifies API calls, database connections, and third-party integrations.
Prevents system failures due to mismatched data structures or incorrect interface implementations.
🔸 Example:

Testing if a user login module properly connects to the authentication system and retrieves the correct user data.
Tools: Postman, Selenium, Mocha.
3. System Testing
📌 Definition:

System testing evaluates the entire software application to ensure that it meets specified requirements.
It checks the software’s performance, security, usability, and functionality in a real-world environment.
🔹 Importance:

**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**

**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input queries to optimize the responses or behavior of an AI model. This process requires a deep understanding of the model’s capabilities, limitations, and training data, enabling users to structure prompts effectively to achieve the most accurate and meaningful outputs.
Effective prompt engineering is essential for maximizing the potential of AI models, ensuring responses are precise, coherent, and contextually relevant. Without well-crafted prompts, users may encounter challenges such as incomplete or irrelevant responses, inconsistencies, or biases in the output, ultimately limiting the model’s usability and effectiveness.

For instance, if a user wants to ask an AI model for restaurant recommendations, a well-crafted prompt would include relevant information such as the user's location, dietary preferences, and budget. A prompt like “Can you recommend some vegetarian restaurants in Lagos, Nigeria with prices under NGN 2000 per person?” provides the model with the necessary context to generate a more accurate and helpful response, compared to a vague prompt like “What are some good restaurants?”

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Provide an overview of recent advancements in artificial intelligence, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and its applications in business."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
1. Instead of broadly asking about "technology," it focuses on artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP).
2. It directs the response toward recent advancements rather than a general history.
3. It specifies business applications, ensuring the response is useful for a targeted audience.
4. The AI generates a more relevant, informative, and actionable response.
